<h1>Cookie Counter</h1>
<p>This project is a simple "cookie counter" that stores and remembers web cookies. Users can visit the page and add cookies to their total. If the user navigates away from the page, the totals remain the same upon return. There is also the ability to clear the cookies if desired.</p>
<p>This page requires a server to function properly. From the command line on a mac, enter <code>echo -e '\nalias served="ruby -run -e httpd . -p 5000"' >> ~/.bash_profile && source ~/.bash_profile</code>. Then type <code>served</code>, and you should have a local sesrver hosting the index.html page at <code>localhost:5000</code>.</p>
<p>This project was completed as part of the New York Code & Design Academy's Web Development Intensive course.</p>

<h2>Future Additions</h2>
<p>This project could benefit from the following additions:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Setting an expiration on the cookie for [one day, one week, etc.]</li>
</ul>
