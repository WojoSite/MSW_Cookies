<h1>Cookie Counter</h1>
<p>This project is a simple "cookie counter" that stores and remembers web cookies for a fictional cookie shop. Users can visit the page and add cookies to their total. If the user navigates away from the page, the totals remain the same upon return. There is also the ability to clear the cookies if desired.</p>
<p>This page requires a server to function properly. From the command line (on a Mac or a machine with Ruby installed), enter <code>echo -e '\nalias served="ruby -run -e httpd . -p 5000"' >> ~/.bash_profile && source ~/.bash_profile</code>. When that is done, open a separate tab in the command line and run the server by entering <code>served</code>, and you should have a local server hosting the index.html page at <code>localhost:5000</code>.</p>
<p>This project was completed as part of the New York Code & Design Academy's Web Development Intensive course.</p>

<h2>Future Additions</h2>
<p>This project could benefit from the following additions:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Setting an expiration on the cookie for [one day, one week, etc.]</li>
</ul>
